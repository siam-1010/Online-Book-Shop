        <h3><font color="maroon">MARKETING</font></h3>
        <p>A marketing degree is an academic course of study on how to promote products and services to a target audience. Marketing majors 
            learn how to find out what people want, understand the needs of different customer segments, communicate how a product or service
             fills those needs, and guide potential customers to take action. 

        Marketing degree coursework combines theory and practice, so that graduates can enter careers equipped to help companies increase 
        their profitability and brand recognition. 
        
        Marketing degrees share some similarities with business administration, advertising, and public relations, but there are some key 
        differences youâ€™ll need to know as you consider majoring in marketing:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Business administration is broader in scope than marketing, and covers topics such as management, accounting, and 
                corporate leadership, as well as marketing.  </li>
            <li>Advertising is part of marketing, but more narrow in scope. Advertising focuses on promoting a brand and its products 
                through paid channels.  </li>
            <li>While marketing focuses on generating leads and promoting products to a target audience, public relations focuses on maintaining 
                a positive reputation for a company.</li>
        </ul>
