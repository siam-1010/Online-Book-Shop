        <p>Social workers make an important contribution to the wellbeing and improvement of society. With a strong commitment to 
            social justice and human rights, social workers can be found working with people who are disadvantaged and marginalised by 
            society because of poverty or personal circumstances. As a UOW Social Work graduate you will enter the labour market with extensive
             skills and knowledge, and supervised professional practice experience. You will be ready to promote social change and development,
              and improve the lives of individuals, families and communities.
