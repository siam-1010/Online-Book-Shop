        <p>BSc (Hons) Management is a broad-based course which allows you to study the full range of management subjects. However, 
            you can also choose to specialise in accounting and finance, human resources, innovation, strategy and entrepreneurship, 
            international business economics or marketing. With a wide range of course units to  choose from, you really can shape your own 
            degree.</p>

            <p>
            Your chosen specialism will be reflected in your degree title e.g. BSc (Hons) Management (Marketing) - however, if you 
            do not wish to specialise, you will graduate in BSc (Hons) Management. Since the Management and Management (Specialism) degrees 
            are identical in the first year, transfer between them is straightforward, so you should apply for only one of them .
