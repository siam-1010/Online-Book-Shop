        <p>A degree in English language and literature is designed to get you reading books, analyzing theories, critiquing prose 
            and verse, and taking a more critical look at the signs and words surrounding us every day. The aim is to get students thinking 
            creatively and analytically about the English language; this differs from other modern language degrees as it is intended for 
            students already proficient in written and spoken English. An English degree can focus equally on the literature and language 
            sides, while others specialize in one or the other; this will usually be clear from the course title.</p>

            <p>An English language-focused degree will train students to analyze the workings of the English language outside of literature, 
                including language-based communication in all kinds of forms and contexts. This could include analysis of casual spoken 
                conversation, text speak, advertising methods or the uses of language in specialized legal and medical discourse.</p>
