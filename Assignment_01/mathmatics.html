        <h3><font color="maroon">MATHMATICS</font></h3>
        <p>A typical mathematics degree program involves a combination of pure (theory and abstract) mathematics and applied 
            (practical application to the world) mathematics. Some institutions also offer pure and applied mathematics as separate degrees, 
            so you can choose to focus on just one. Mathematics is also often offered as a joint-honors degree, paired with subjects including 
            business management, computer science, economics, finance, history, music, philosophy, physics, sports science and statistics.

        </p>

<p>
    Entry requirements for mathematics degrees usually only emphasize an academic background in mathematics. Applicants may be required 
    to have studied some or all of the following: further mathematics, pure mathematics, mechanics and complex numbers. Experience of 
    studying other scientific subjects may also be welcomed, and can help provide an additional dimension to your studies.</p>
